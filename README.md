# Support_Vector_Mechanism

## **Project Title :** using the support vector mecganism algorithm of supervised machine learning,predict iris.csv dataset to find out sepcies.

##**Problem Statment :** A american based botanical garden a grow iris flower in there labs but using bio technology in a single tree differnet types of variety flowers is grow.find out as a data cientist how much accuracy is there all categories contains same species.

**Conclusion :** According to my support vector mechanism model the species are linear. with the accuracy of 1.00 
Hence,proved model was succesfull implement
